Employee Password: Password@1234
```
## Security Measures

To ensure the security of the PayView Payment Portal, the following measures have been implemented against common attacks:

### 1. Session Jacking
- Regenerate Session ID on every login and use OTP for verification of login.

### 2. Clickjacking
- Implemented Z-Frame-Options Header.
- Configured Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 3. SQL Injection
- Utilized Supabase SDK, parameterized queries, and input validation.

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Configured Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 5. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Enforced HTTPS.
- Enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

### 6. DDoS Attacks
- Implemented rate limiting.
- Used CAPTCHA for login and registration.

### Additional Measures
- Included CORS as needed.
- SSL/TLS certificate configured using Netlify and the domain host.
- Hashing and salting of password before storing it in the database
- Used RegEx in Frontend to validate input

## PayView API Documentation

This document outlines the API endpoints for the PayView Customer Portal, a platform designed for secure online payments and detailed visualization of payment history. The API facilitates user registration, login, payment processing, address management, and communication with customer support.

### Notes

* All API endpoints are assumed to be prefixed with `/api/`.
* All POST requests require a JSON body.
* The `sessionToken` is used to authenticate all user data endpoints and the customer support endpoint.
* The `capVal` parameter in `/register` and `/login` is used for reCAPTCHA validation to prevent bot submissions.
* Password complexity is enforced during registration and password changes.
* Successful payment processing through `/payment` will redirect the user to the dashboard. 

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the PayView Customer Portal API. For more detailed information, refer to the source code comments.
